            "description": "If you have visited New York, there is a good chance you have been to this iconic bagel shop. Some would refer to it as a historical landmark, as it has been on the map for more than 100 years. You cannot leave this Russ & Daughters without trying the most classic item on their menu—maybe the most classic item in all of New York—the lox bagel. The salmon is a melt-in-your-mouth type of delicious. Top it with some capers, tomato, and red onion and you’ve found yourself one of the best bagels in NYC.",

The richness of the omelet and cream cheese makes for the perfect breakfast and is incredibly tasty and filling. Bonus points: Murray’s baked goods and drinks are outstanding as well. Grab a western omelet bagel here then walk along the High Line, which is just a few blocks away",

We recommend sinking your teeth into the vegetarian scramble on the everything bagel. The fresh veggies mixed with egg and jalapeño cream cheese is an explosion of flavor. There are so many elements happening on just one bagel but it is refreshing and surprisingly light. Each bite has you wanting more, and we won’t tell anyone if you shed a tear as you take your last bite.",

Even if you opt for a plain bagel and original cream cheese, you’ll be blown away by the quality and flavor at Liberty Bagels.

This shop is tucked away in the non-grid streets of the financial district but is absolutely worth seeking out. Their lox on a pumpernickel bagel is a pairing that is unparalleled. Not every bagel place does lox right, but Leo’s nails it with lox that is soft, flavorful, and fresh. After scarfing down your delicious bagel, you’ll have energy to take on the rest of the city. Grab one to go, then walk a few blocks south for a view of Lady Liberty; a quintessential New York moment.",

The bagel itself is soft, chewy, easy to bite into, and has so much flavor. This is a great pitstop near many famous, tourist-friendly sites, but you might find that these bagels are actually the main attraction.",
